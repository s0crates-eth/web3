## NOTES:
>> need to do:
- go through the HTML code and try to cut the fat; I tried to just delete as is right now, but its still deactivating stuff
- Also, I think I need to run through the JS code and really check and understand whats happening. Maybe reorganize the code into a way that I can understand.
