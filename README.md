## NOTES:
> TODO:
>> JUST REALIZED THAT ITS READING from the bundle.js, so I need to stop that and get it to read from the index.js
>> go through the HTML code and try to cut the fat; I tried to just delete as is right now, but its still deactivating stuff
>> Also, I think I need to run through the JS code and really check and understand whats happening. Maybe reorganize the code into a way that I can understand.
